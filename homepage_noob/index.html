                                            Seville is the centerpiece of your experience, a beautiful and ancient city with a temperate climate and a rich cultural life. The setting of operas Don Giovanni, The Marriage of Figaro, and Carmen; birthplace of painters Velázquez and Murillo; Moorish palaces and Renaissance gardens; paintings, statues, and world-famous ceramic tiles. At the same time, Seville is very cosmopolitan. The bustling commercial center is filled with traditional business and trade activities, and an efficient public transportation system links the various neighborhoods and attractions. The sevillanos are a gracious and social people – welcoming to visitors and eager to introduce them to the life and culture of their city.

                                            Seville is the centerpiece of your experience, a beautiful and ancient city with a temperate climate and a rich cultural life. The setting of operas Don Giovanni, The Marriage of Figaro, and Carmen; birthplace of painters Velázquez and Murillo; Moorish palaces and Renaissance gardens; paintings, statues, and world-famous ceramic tiles. At the same time, Seville is very cosmopolitan. The bustling commercial center is filled with traditional business and trade activities, and an efficient public transportation system links the various neighborhoods and attractions. The sevillanos are a gracious and social people – welcoming to visitors and eager to introduce them to the life and culture of their city.
